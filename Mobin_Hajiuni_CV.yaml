    Introduction:
      - I am a backend developer skilled in designing and building modular, high-throughput systems. My work primarily involves
        creating scalable architectures, and I am now developing proficiency in Data Science and Machine Learning. I have
        successfully deployed production systems that utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and intelligent agents. My goal is
        to apply my strong foundation in software engineering to develop more sophisticated, data-informed applications.
